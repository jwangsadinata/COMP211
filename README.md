# COMP211
(Since some of my code for this class can be used as a solution to future classes, I removed my code for class assignments from this repository. For code samples, please contact me through email at jason.christian19@gmail.com)

Coursework for Intro to Computer Science (Principles of Imperative Computation), written in c0.

This is a repository containing my coursework to the gateway to computer science major at Wesleyan University, written in c0 under Professor Daniel R. Licata. This coursework discusses about the basics of imperative programming and introduces me to the different data structures. Some of the class assignments and projects incorporate the use of different data structures (stacks, queues, priority queues, doubly linked lists, gap buffers, heaps) and basic interfaces to separate client codes and implementation codes.

Topics discussed in class include:
- Basic programming (Control flow, Datatypes, Representations, Arrays and Array bounds, Memory Safety)
- Contracts (precondition, postcondition of a function)
- Sorting Algorithm (mainly Selection Sort and Quicksort)
- Searching Algorithm (Linear Search and Binary Search)
- Pointers and Structs
- Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Gap Buffers
- Unbounded arrays
- Time constraints and amortized analysis
- Hash Tables, Priority Queues/Heaps
- Graphs as interconnected data structure (including Breadth First Search and Depth First Search)

Class assignments and projects include:
- Cryptography (implementing basic contracts, shift ciphers, and decryptors)
- Images (using code to manipulate image properties such as color, alpha, rotations and quantization)
- Twitter (implementation of searching and sorting algorithms to find the most common words in tweets)
- Claculator (based on the idea developed by Reverse Polish Systems (RPS), this project implements a stack-based programming language for an interactive calculator)
- Text editor (creating a text editor using a gap buffer and doubly linked lists for a better space-saving mechanism)
- Compression (using the idea of Huffman coding on a prefix-free codeword, this project includes using interface for both client and implementation, and ultimately create a compression of the twitter data files produced in the earlier assignment)
